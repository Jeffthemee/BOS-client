# BOS-client
I fucked around and found out......
Here is all the releases for my BOS-client

## Clearing the air
This application is not a VRChat client and does not modify the game in any manner whatsoever. Its sole function is to parse the VRChat output log for user joins and cross-check them against blacklisted users on my API.
### How to install.
Step 1: download the latest output.exe and config.json file from the relese section of this github repo, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Jeffthemee/BOS-client/releases)<br> 
Step 2: Make sure these two files are in their own folder <br>

Step 3(optional): Create a webhook on discord by right clicking the channel you want to make a webhook for, press edit channel then go down to integrations, create webhook and then copy the URL. <br>
Step 4: Open the config.json file and change the text right after Users to the name of your current windows user also paste in the webhook url where it says "MainLogger": "Webhooks" <br>

Step 5: Boot up Vrchat and run output.exe <br>
Step 6: A command promnt like window should open up and start logging user joins and leaves. <br>
